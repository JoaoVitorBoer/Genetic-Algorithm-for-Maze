# Maze Solver Genetic Algorithm

This project implements a genetic algorithm (GA) designed to solve mazes. Using a combination of genetic operations such as selection, crossover, and mutation, this algorithm evolves a population of solutions towards the optimal path through a given maze. This implementation is only for education purposes.

- **Genetic Operations:** Implements selection, crossover, and mutation to evolve solutions.
- **Maze Support:** Capable of solving various maze configurations.
- **Visualization:** Includes functionality to visualize the maze and the solution process.
